The following features are planned for future versions of GNU libavl.
Please keep in mind these plans are subject to change.  There is no
predictable timeline for any of this, because libavl is developed as
time becomes available.  Your feedback, including suggestions for
prioritization or additional features, is welcomed at <blp@gnu.org>.
